This project is an independent fork of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to [LibreFox](https://github.com/intika/Librefox)

LibreWolf uses more than 500 privacy/security/performance settings, patches, LibreWolf-Addons (optional) and is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as possible (updater, crashreporter and Firefox's integrated addons that don't respect privacy are removed).

**LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.**


## Features
- Latest Version of Firefox: LibreWolf is compiled directly from the latest build of Firefox Stable. You will have the the latest features, and security updates.
- Completely Independent Build: LibreWolf uses a completely independent build from Firefox and has its own settings, profile folder and installation path. As a result, it can be installed alongside Firefox or any other browser.
- Extensions firewall: limit internet access for extensions.
- IJWY (I Just Want You To Shut Up): embedded server links and other calling home functions are removed. In other words, zero unauthorized or background connections by default.
- User settings updates: gHacks/pyllyukko base is kept up to date.
- Settings protection: important settings are enforced/locked within `librewolf.cfg` and `policies.json`, those settings cannot be changed by addons/updates/LibreWolf itself or unwanted/accidental manipulation; To change those settings you can easily do it by editing `librewolf.cfg` and `policies.json`.
- LibreWolf-addons: set of optional LibreWolf extensions
- Statistics disabled: telemetry and similar functions are disabled
- Tested settings: settings are performance aware
- Multi-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac/and soon Android)
- Dark theme (classic and advanced)
- Recommended and *code reviewed* addons list
- Community-Driven
- And much more...
